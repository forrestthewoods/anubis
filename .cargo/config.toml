# Linker configuration for faster link times.
#
# On Linux, use lld (LLVM's linker) instead of GNU ld.
# This provides faster linking, especially for debug builds.
# lld is included with most LLVM/Clang installations.
#
# On Windows, MSVC's linker is used by default and is already fast.
# On macOS, the default linker is already fast.
