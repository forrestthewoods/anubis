# Nested static library example demonstrating diamond dependency pattern:
#
#       main
#      /    \
#    foo    bar
#      \    /
#       util
#
# Both foo and bar depend on util, but util should only be built once.
# This verifies that issue #18's duplicate prevention works correctly.
#
# This example also demonstrates the Targets() syntax for relative dependencies.
